              Food Not Bombs originated in 1980 when eight anti-nuclear activists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, launched
              bake sales to fund a friendâ€™s legal costs after a their arrest during the May 24th Occupation Attempt of
              Seabrook Nuclear Power Station. <br />
              <br />
              One of the activists was also a volunteer from the local Bread and Circus grocery, and who donated unsold
              produce to nearby housing projects. The presence of a glass tower where nuclear missiles were designed
              influenced the name Food Not Bombs.

              Co-founder Keith McHenry established a second group in San Francisco, deciding to share meals and
              literature every Monday at noon in Golden Gate Park. They applied for a permit from the Recreation and
              Parks Department, receiving no response until August 15, 1988, when 45 riot police arrested nine
              volunteers. <br />
              <br />
              Media coverage sparked widespread support, leading to over 100 people marching the next Monday. The police
              made 29 arrests, gaining global attention.

              News of the San Francisco arrests inspired the formation of Food Not Bombs groups in Seattle, Washington;
              Victoria, British Columbia; New York City, New York; and Washington, D.C.A <br />
              <br />A Spanish group was the first to translate the Food Not Bombs book, leading to a European book tour,
              which connected with Europeans opposing the European Union and the World Trade Organization. Inspired,
              Spanish activists in turn sought to join a North American tour, resulting in the UnFree Trade Tour.
              Covering 60 cities, it featured a World Trade Organization video and encouraged disrupting WTO Summits.

              In April 2009, the city of Middletown, Connecticut issued a cease-and-desist order to the local Food Not
              Bombs (FNB) chapter, citing the organization for distributing food without a license. In 2011, FNB faced
              feeding bans in Florida, and similar laws emerged in other places like Philadelphia and Houston. <br />
              <br />
              In April 2011, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an Orlando ordinance, reversing a previous ruling
              and removing a permanent injunction against it. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer faced criticism for referring to
              FNB activists as &#34;food terrorists.&#34;
